Auto Skip Intro, Recaps for Prime, Netflix and Other OTTs

OTTs Supported

It is very tedious to skip those long intro sequences and recaps on Netflix and Amazon Prime, you have to press the skip button each time.

And those Ads on Amazon prime are so annoying, right? No worries, we have got you covered.

We have a solution for our super lazy user. Now you can:

- Auto Skips intros and recaps on both Netflix and Prime
- Auto Skips credits and play next episode on Prime
- Auto Skips "Continue watching on Netflix"
- Auto Skips Ads on Prime

## Add your national language (Prime)

So currently Skip Intro, Skip Recap, Next episode skip works for 22 languages supported by prime.
But skip Ads in only supported in a few languages, to enable that in your language, I would need your help in translation of the word `Skip` to your national language.

Please have a look at the file `src/utils/i18n.js`, and add the respective value against keyword `skip_ads` in `i18nMap`.

Please test it in your system, raise a PR and tag me for review. Ping me if you have any doubts.
